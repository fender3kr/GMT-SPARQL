# GMT-SPARQL
<h2>Graph Mining Tool in SPARQL </h2>

### Description
Resource Description Framework (RDF) has been one of popular graph data models. It is a standard for modeling resources on the web and their links (or relationship). It comes with a standard query language called SPARQL, which enables users to perform graph pattern matching tasks in an intuitive manner. However, data scientists still need to mine graph data represented in RDF. ["GM-SPARQL"](https://github.com/ssrangan/gm-sparql) developed in ORNL provides several important graph mining algorithms. Those algorithms can run on Jena-based triplestores and Cray's uRiKA machines. This repository additionally maintains five mining operations written in Java for Sesame-based triplestores. This also contains five operations for Jena systems which have been further optimized or written in more clear way.
